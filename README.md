## Conclusion

I have spent with a total of 4 hours with this test and I have 2 tasks undone:
1. Task 2 (bullet #2), showing all booking information when room name is clicked from the list view.
2. Adding new booking information.

## Assumptions, thoughts and improvements

My assumptions:
1. Any libraries can be used.
2. This test is about working with the functionality.
3. Task 2 (bullet #2) can just be a simple filter function in the list view page based on room name.

I respect the allocated time so I tried to do as much as I can with 4 hours limit by focusing with the functionalites and
disregard the aesthetics. I assume that there's no limitation on how I would like to build the project so I decided to
use libraries that I'm very comfortable using.

If I have given more time, like 2-4 more hours, then I believe I would be able to complete all the tasks. Add some UI interactions such as showing a confirmation diablog box when removing or updating a booking. Store and use the last state of the number of rows to show in the list page for a much better user experience. I will be able to clean and refactor some of my codes such as splitting my components and making them reusable. For example: Creating a reusable Form component for updating and adding booking; Using Suspense to avoid race conditions when data is fetching.
